### Hide Notification about this Extension Debugging the Browser
![Annoying Notification about this Extension Debugging the Browser](img/readme/notification-bad.png)

This notification won't go away on its own because the extension doesn't stop debugging the browser. It can be prevented from popping up by using  `--silent-debugger-extension-api` command line switch in a shortcut to your browser.

## Limitations
### Internet Explorer User Agent String Options
User agent strings aren't stored as a constant anywhere in this program. They are simply generated when you select a device/operating system and a browser. The information about the device/operating system is cocantenated to the part of the user agent string with information about navigator.appVersion. Then information about the browser is cocantenated to this. For most versions of IE, information about the browser is addeded before information about the device/operating system, so none of these strings can be generated by this program.

### Creepjs
When visiting the creepjs website to help test and debug this program, the tab had to be refreshed 1-3 times for changes to be reflected. Also this extension could only be used to change the user agent string 1-3 times before the creepjs website began displaying the real useragent in the Navigator section. Finally, creepjs can detect that your user agent was spoofed and reveals the real user agent in the Worker section of the site.

### Testing
This extension has only been tested on Brave and Google Chrome. Issues from other browsers are unknown.
